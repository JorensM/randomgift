                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <h3>What kinds of gifts can I receive?</h3>
                <p>When filling out your order, you will be able to specify a 
                category or multiple categories of kinds of products which you would like
                to receive. Categories include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tech</li>
                    <li>Decor</li>
                    <li>Beauty</li>
                    <li>Handmade</li>
                    <li>Clothing</li>
                    <li>Books</li>
                    <li>Video-game themed toys/accessories</li>
                    <li>Animal toys</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Additionally you will be able to specify the color of the gift and whether you want to receive
                    multiple small gifts in 1 package or a single larger gift.
                </p>
                <h3>Where are you getting the gifts from?</h3>
                <p>The gifts are sourced from several major retailers such as Etsy, Amazon, Temu</p>
                <h3>Will you package the gift?</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently we don't offer gift packaging as we send the gift straight to you.
                    This keeps to costs down since we don't have to ship the item twice, but in the
                    future we would like to offer an option to package your gift before sending it to you.
                </p>
                <h3>Are the items brand new?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we only order brand new items</p>
                <h3>Do you offer refunds?</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the nature of the service, we will rarely refund a gift, unless
                    it has been found to be damaged when you received it.
                </p>
